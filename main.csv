"Alright, I see that many of the responses are pretty long. That's not a bad thing, but it's different from what I expected. Considering MonikAI would react to every single action and it would basically trigger a 1 minute monologue (and often the same over and over again). So I propose two ideas:","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Possible best-of-both-worlds idea. You could set it up to trigger the shorter responses more often (or always), and the longer ones only some of the time. Only question is where would the cut-off between short and long be.","Hm, good idea. Might be interesting to make it based on a formula or something. So basically sample from a list that includes shorter answers more, based on the inverse of the amount of lines.. Hm, I'll think about that.","How 'bout dis: Make it so it only happens by chance, except for the first time an action is triggered. That way, people can experience Monika's reaction deterministically, but she doesn't spam a user.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"In true fashion to the MAS mod, I like the longer responses. Letting her talk to get whats on her chest off to the user just seems right. Considering the lore, she is trapped all day in our computer with nothing but her thoughts. She must have a lot to say. Also with the amount of responses people are adding, I feel like there isn't too much of a worry of her repeating herself unless used a lot, and at that point, I think we would have more subbmission anyways.     -Pope","Pi approved","Making her an independent AI that reacts(or responds) to the user's input,  
rather than a code based around the input, would make for a more 'natural' 
feel. This could be accomplished by building her up with a sort of 
indifference to the player. (her favorite color is green regardless of your 
choices) Perhaps a loop(stand in for flowing cognitive thought) with options
 to accept the occasional player input(like a thinking person agreeing or 
disagreeing).

"Would it be possible to make a file directly linked to the program and that is where she will get her lines from? Also would it be possible to set a percentage system at the same file? -VyxVin","Not sure what you mean with percentage system, but the idea with this spreadsheet is that I will basically let MonikAI read the spreadsheet itself directly (not this editable version, for obvious reasons, but a copy)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Also, is it possible for Monika to react to in-game functions?
